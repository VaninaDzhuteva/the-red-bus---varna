                	This means that we know each child and his/her parents well. We pride ourselves in having good working relationships with 
                	both students and parents. Because we are small, we can give your child quality
                    attention in the class and give immediate feedback to parents regarding their child's progress.

                    combination of two popular and successful UK phonics programmes.
                    This ensures your child gets a range of stimulating activities. Jennifer works hard to stay up to date with recent research 
                    and developments in the phonics world.</p>

                  and believes that children should be supported and encouraged to develop grit and tenacity. Children are taught to see mistakes as 
                  opportunities to learn and grow. As such, the teaching is holistic and child-centred.</p>
